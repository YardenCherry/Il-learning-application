# Il learning 
<p>IL-learning is a comprehensive application tailored to connect students with teachers for private lessons. The app simplifies the process of finding the right teacher for specific subjects and scheduling lessons according to individual preferences.

Students can easily search for teachers based on various criteria such as subject expertise, availability, and price per lesson. Once a suitable teacher is found, students can schedule lessons according to the teacher's working hours.

Teachers, on the other hand, can register and create profiles detailing their experience, subjects taught, hourly rates, and availability. They have the flexibility to manage their schedules and accept lesson requests from students.

IL-learning provides a user-friendly interface for both students and teachers to interact, making it convenient to arrange personalized learning experiences. With features like user authentication, profile management, and class scheduling, IL-learning aims to streamline the process of private lessons for both students and teachers alike.</p>
